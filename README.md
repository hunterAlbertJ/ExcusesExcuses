There were a lot of aspects of this project that I was extremely grateful for. The immense blocks of time to just code away was paradise.
Some great experiece that I gained from this project was the ability to change direction in how I was going to accomplish a certain aspect yet
still remaining in the general direction that the project needed to head in.
Some things I would have done differently next time would be to get better aquainted with flex box and make the project more dynamic/moblie freindly
Another aspect that I did not consider was that not every browser supports the same features so there are some parts of my project that only work in safari. oops
